# Chapter 6: Best Practices Examples

## Overview

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating best practices for template development, including performance optimization, security measures, testing strategies, and deployment considerations.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# For Python examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Examples

1. **Performance Optimization**
   ```bash
   node performance-optimization.js
   ```

2. **Security Best Practices**
   ```bash
   node security-practices.js
   ```

3. **Testing Strategies**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   ```bash
   node deployment-monitoring.js
   ```

## Examples Overview

### 1. Performance Optimization (`performance-optimization.js`)
- Template compilation and caching strategies
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Batch processing for multiple templates
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 2. Security Best Practices (`security-practices.js`)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Template injection prevention
- Secure template management

### 3. Testing Strategies (`testing-strategies.js`)
- Unit testing for templates
- Integration testing with data sources
- Visual regression testing
- Test utilities and helpers

### 4. Deployment and Monitoring (`deployment-monitoring.js`)
- Environment-specific configuration
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling and logging
- Health checks and metrics

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Template Design Principles**: Separation of concerns, DRY, progressive enhancement
- **Performance**: Caching, lazy loading, batch processing, monitoring
- **Security**: Input validation, CSP, injection prevention
- **Maintainability**: Organization, documentation, version control
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, visual regression testing
- **Deployment**: Environment config, monitoring, error handling

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Performance Optimization** to understand caching and optimization techniques
2. Move to **Security Best Practices** to learn about security measures
3. Explore **Testing Strategies** to understand comprehensive testing approaches
4. Finish with **Deployment and Monitoring** to learn production considerations

## Expected Outcomes

After completing these examples, you'll understand:
- How to optimize template performance in production
- Security best practices for template systems
- Comprehensive testing strategies for templates
- Deployment and monitoring considerations
- Enterprise-level template system architecture
